        <h1> Laboratory Experiment Results </h1>
            <h2><u> Food Processing Stages </u></h2>
            <h3><u> Preview of the Food Proccessing Stages </u></h3>
            <h4> We placed some bananas and crackers in a zip-lock bag and crushed them.  We observed that the bag acted like the mouth and the crushing of food is similar to the mechanical digestion of the teeth where food is broken down into smaller particles.  Then water was added to the mixture.  The water serves as a lubricant for the food, much like how saliva lubricates the food in our mouth.  After that, orange juice was added to the mixture.  In this stage, we observed that the bag resembles the stomach where food is chemically broken down.  We noticed that the chemically digestive properties of stomach acid are emulated by the orange juice, as both are acidic substances that have similar pH values.  Since the bananas and crackers are broken down by acidic orange juice, the biomolecules digested in the simulation are likely protein, as stomach acid contains enzymes called pepsin that digest protein. </h4>
            <h3><u> Crushing Stage </u></h3>
            <h4> Question 1 Answer: This part of the simulation represents the ingestion of food into the oral cavity.</h4>
            <h4> Question 2 Answer: The addition of water represents the incorporation of saliva into the ingested food.</h4>
            <h4> Question 3 Answer: Because the bananas and crackers were placed here, the zip-locked bag represents the stomach.</h4>
            <h4> Question 4 Answer: Crushing the food simulates the chewing done in the mouth. This breaks down the food into smaller pieces, preparing it for digestion via the stomach.</h4>
            <h4> Question 5 Answer: Orange juice may represent the acid found in our stomachs, as both are highly acidic and have similar pH levels.</h4>
            <h4> Question 6 Answer: The biomolecules digested in the simulation are likely carbohydrates (as the crackers are from processed grains and bananas are fruit) and lipids (from the oil in the cracker dough).</h4>

            <h3><u> Transfer Stage </u></h3>
            <h4> Question 7 Answer: This represents the extraction of liquid from the chyme.</h4>
            <h4> Question 8 Answer: The tray represents the bloodstream as this is where the water and nutrients go.</h4>
            <h4> Question 9 Answer: There is left a partially solid substance which is called chyme.</h4>
            <h4> Question 10 Answer: The partially solid substance, when pushed, secretes out the remaining liquid. The action would be peristalsis in the stomach and intestines.</h4>

            <h2><u> Absorption </u></h2>
            <h4> Question 11 Answer: In this experiment, we prepared the set-up by filling four graduated cylinders with equal amounts of water, and folded four paper towels of the same size, increasing the amount of folds each time. Afterwards, we fully dipped a paper towel in each cylinder and measured the difference in the water level after taking the towels out. </h4>
            <h4> Question 12 Answer: We observed that the paper towel with the most folds (4) absorbed the most amount of liquid. This may be due to the fact that folding an object increases its surface area, therefore allowing more of it to be in contact with liquid and absorb more water. This is similar to how villi in the small intestine work, and helps it easily absorb the nutrients in the food. The small intestine itself is also extremely folded inside the body to maximize the space available and, again, allows it to absorb nutrients easily. As the villi are also extremely thin, it is able to absorb the nutrients quickly through a process called diffusion.</h4>

            <h2><u> Simulation of Bile Action </u></h2>
            <h4> Question 13 Answer: Bile aids in chemical digestion by helping the body break down fats into fatty acids through the emulsification of fats. The end products of this process can be easily absorbed by the body.</h4>
